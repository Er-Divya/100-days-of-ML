# 100 Days of Machine Learning
This repository contains a combination of 100 machine learning algorithms and projects that I will be practicing to sharpen my ML skills.

# About
Machine learning is a rapidly evolving and transformative field, with applications spanning various sectors like healthcare, finance, retail, and technology. As businesses increasingly adopt machine learning to drive innovation and efficiency, mastering these concepts has become crucial. Through this challenge, I aim to not only deepen my understanding of the underlying algorithms, tools, and methodologies, but also explore real-world applications. By engaging in hands-on projects, I aspire to develop practical skills that will allow me to solve complex problems and apply machine-learning techniques to diverse scenarios.
